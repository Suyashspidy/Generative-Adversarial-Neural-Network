Generative Adversarial Neural Network for Synthetic Data Generation
This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built from scratch using Python and TensorFlow. The GAN is designed to generate synthetic datasets, which can be used for various purposes such as data augmentation, overcoming class imbalance, or creating new training data for machine learning models.

Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive setting. The generator learns to generate synthetic data samples that are similar to the training data, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and synthetic data samples.

Features
Implementation of a GAN architecture from scratch using Python and TensorFlow.
Customizable architecture to accommodate different dataset structures and dimensions.
Ability to generate synthetic datasets for various applications in machine learning and data analysis.
Easy-to-use interface for training the GAN model and generating synthetic data.
Usage
To use this GAN for synthetic data generation, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Suyashspidy/Generative-Adversarial-Neural-Network.git
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately for training.

Configure the GAN parameters: Adjust the hyperparameters and network architecture in the configuration files according to your dataset and requirements.

Train the GAN model: Run the training script to train the GAN on your dataset.

python train.py
Generate synthetic data: Once the model is trained, use the generator to create synthetic data samples.

python generate.py
